    "The CML's database of intracranial and scalp EEG comes in a pandas dataframe format. All the pertinent data about each experimental session is recorded in a row of a large dataframe. These databases are organized around experimental protocols. For example, the <b>'r1'</b> database contains all DARPA RAM data, while the **'pyfr'** database includes all free-recall intracranial data collected in the years prior to RAM. \n",

We're going to use **CMLReaders**, which is a custom library with helper functions to load data for any experiments run by the CML. If you don't already have CMLReaders installed, please follow the instructions here: https://github.com/pennmem/cmlreaders"
